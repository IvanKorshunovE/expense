# üöÄ ExpenseTracker

A simple Django-based application to manage and track personal and business expenses.
The app follows **Clean Architecture** principles. While this approach may seem like an overkill for a small project, 
as the application scales, the benefits of a layered architecture and dependency injection become more significant.

## üìú Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Django  
- Django REST framework  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Set Up the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IvanKorshunovE/expense
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd expense
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```
    - Configure your `.env` file based on the `env-example` template.

4. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
    ```

5. Load fixtures (text data) into the database:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml exec expense_app sh ./fixtures/load_fixtures.sh
    ```
